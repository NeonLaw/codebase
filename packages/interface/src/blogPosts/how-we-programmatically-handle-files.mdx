We consider files grouped data that is not stored in our primary PostgreSQL
database, such as images, Microsoft Word documents, PDF files, audio and video.

## Storage in GCP Buckets

We maintain four GCP buckets for storing files, in two of these buckets, the
`Private Assets` and the `Writing` bucket, each file has an associative
PostgreSQL row.

### Public Bucket

The Public Bucket is for files that can be served anywhere and accessed by
anyone, such as public websites and video assets.

### Unprocessed Uploads Bucket

Uploaded documents are deleted in 24 hours. A filename in this bucket is the
`base64` encoding of the `uploadURL` created from Transloadit.

### Private Assets Bucket

The User Files document represents saved uploads that are attached to a matter.
Each file follows the format:

`${userId}/matters/${matterId}/filename` or
`${userId}/responses/${responseId}/filename`.

### Company Files Bucket

The Company Bucket contains Word and PDF documents that are not attached to a
matter, for example internal accounting receipts. Currently each file follows
the format:

`/letters/${lettersId}.pdf`

## File Uploads

We use Transloadit to process file uploads from our application. Our upload
process is two HTTP requests. First, a HTTP POST request is made to Transloadit
to upload our file to its server. Second, with the `uploadURL` returned from
`Transloadit`, a user sends a GraphQL mutation request to our API to create a
`response_document` or `matter_document` with either the
`createResponseDocumentFromTransloadit` or `createMatterDocumentFromTransloadit`
mutation respectively.

### Choose a Transloadit Template and `getTransloaditToken`

### Upload to Transloadit

After you upload a file to Transloadit, Transloadit will return an `uploadURL`
in the response body. This `uploadURL` is what is sent to `react-hook-form`.

### After Transloadit Processes the File, the `Unprocessed Upload` Bucket

### Create a Matter Document or Response Document
