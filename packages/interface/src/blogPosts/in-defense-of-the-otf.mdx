  The Open Technology Fund has been an incredible steward for
  privacy-protecting policies to ensure journalists world-wide can report the
  truth and humans everywhere can use a free Internet. We call on our
  government to continue these programs and to stop the current takeover by
  the Trump Administration.

A free and open press is the best check against totalitarian governments
because it provides truth in the face of propaganda. Since its inception in
2012, the Open Technology Fund, or OTF, has funded open-source
privacy-preserving projects like Signal, Tor, and SecureDrop. Journalists
have used these technologies to share and report facts in authoritarian
regimes. And domestic violence victims and members of the LGBTQIA+ community 
have been able to find love and share their stories using OTF-sponsored 
applications without fear of government persecution.

The OTF has a long-standing track record of success in large part due their
community-first approach that they've organically grown over the years. The
trust that they've cultivated has [allowed the OTF to support projects around
the
world](https://www.opentech.fund/news/community-building-rapid-response/),
including repressive environments like China, Hong Kong, and Iran.

All of OTF's great work, unfortunately, is at risk - the Trump
administration is threatening to dismantle the OTF and have already tried to
fire OTF leadership and replace them with unqualified people. Additionally,
people tied to the takeover want OTF to fund closed-source projects, which lack
the accountability current OTF-funded projects have because there is no way
to check whether or not the software has back-doors or is using
cryptographically sound code. As a result, the OTF and the Trump-backed
United States Agency for Global Media, or USAGM, are currently in court as
OTF is attempting to prevent this takeover.

no longer perceived as an independent advocate for its vital projects
because of what the Trump administration has recently done.

We hope the court, Congress, and all relevant parties in our government
realize how great the OTF has been, and how vital it is to protect its
independence so it can be a beacon for Internet freedom around the world. To
