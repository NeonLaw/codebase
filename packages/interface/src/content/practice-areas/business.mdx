### Opinionated, Open Source Legal Work

The only way we can provide unlimited legal services at this price point is by
sharing as much as possible between the thousands of clients we have served over
the years. We ask each of our clients to allow us open-source the
non-privileged parts of the work we provide them, which you can see on our
[templates page](/templates). We will go over what is and is not privileged when
onboarding you.

##### Footnotes

<sup>1</sup>: Unlimited legal contract and document review is subject to our
opinionated, open-source legal work clause explained above. For work that
falls outside of this scope, we will bill you at our hourly rate of $300 per
hour after your first hour of custom work.
