### Opinionated, Open Source Legal Work

The only way we can provide our all-inclusive legal services plan at this
price point is by leveraging our strong opinions on how to build successful
companies and by sharing as much as possible between the thousands of clients
we have served over the years. We ask each of our clients to allow us
open-source the non-privileged parts of the work we provide them, which you
can see on our [templates page](/templates). If you're working on a
game-changing innovation, we won't disclose that, but things like severance
clauses, arbitration clauses, contractor agreements, privacy policies, are
more or less the same, and are topics we feel our clients should standardize on.
