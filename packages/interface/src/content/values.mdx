We deserve to live in a world where everyone has the basic necessities taken
care of and where no one feels the threat of violence, whether that's physical
or psychological.

It is our mission to serve our community to further us towards what we deserve.

(For the reader, please construe `violence` as liberally as possible. No one
should have to feel uncomfortable to be themselves.)
