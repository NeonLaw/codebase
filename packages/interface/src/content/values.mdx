We deserve to live in a world where everyone has the basic necessities taken
care of and where no one feels the threat of violence, whether that's physical
or psychological.

It is our mission to serve our community to further us towards what we deserve.

(For the reader, please construe `violence` as liberally as possible. No one
should have to feel uncomfortable to be themselves.)

Internally, we strive to build a company built on respect, trust, and
transparency. Every data point is available for anyone in the company to read at
any time, or in other words, there are no secrets amongst our firm. While this
means that conflicts are imputed on the whole firm, we've found this approach
to work well for us.
