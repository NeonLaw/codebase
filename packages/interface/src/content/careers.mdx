We are looking for progressive attorneys to join our firm and help us advance
justice as much as possible using state-of-the-art technology. Since we optomize
for justice, we don't optomize for salary. In fact, everyone's salary is shared
amongst our firm and is between two and five times the minimum wage in your 
locale, depending on your experience. Instead of individual pay, we focus on 
great group benefits like family healthcare, 401k deposits, FSA deposits, 529 
Plan Deposits, and student loan reimbursement for *all* members of our firm, 
irrespective if they are an attorney or not.

Interested? Let's chat in the chat room on the bottom right.
