description: Careers at Neon Law
---

Neon Law is a place where the group matters so much more than the individual.
Here, we celeberate team wins, we always work together, and we will never 
talk behind your back. We run our business transparently to solely focus on 
our mission of providing excellent and affordable legal services because life 
is short, and we'd rather not waste our time with office politics.

We are looking for progressive attorneys, software engineers, and social workers
or people with high EQ to join our firm and help us advance justice as much as 
possible with emotionally-intelligent connections enhanced with state-of-the-art 
technology.
Since we optimize for justice, we don't optimize for salary. Everyone's 
salary is shared amongst our firm and is between two and five times the minimum 
wage in your locale, depending on your experience. Instead of individual pay, we 
focus on great group benefits like family healthcare, 401k deposits, FSA 
deposits, 529 plan deposits, and student loan reimbursement for *all* members of 
our firm, irrespective if they are an attorney or not.
