We are looking for progressive attorneys to join our firm and help us advance
justice as much as possible using state-of-the-art technology. Since we optomize
for justice, we don't optomize for salary. In fact, we cap our salary at 3x what
the lowest paid person in our firm makes. Instead of individual pay, we focus on
great group benefits like healthcare, 401k deposits, FSA deposits, and student
loan reimbursement for *all* members of our firm, irrespective if they are an
attorney or not.

Interested? Let's chat in the chat room on the bottom right.
