The Bar Exam is a(n) (un)necessary part of being qualified to be an attorney.
We feel that what the bar exam tests, isn't representative of the real
practice of law, because a lot of what the bar tests is rote learning based
on memorizing a lot of stuff we could easily Google. We are definitely
supporters of diploma privilege.

Nonetheless, we have open-sourced our approach to passing the bar exam, and
the following flashcards are how we have practice "rule slapdowns", or writing
out rule statements over and over again so that they are ingrained in our
muscle memory.

We recommend the following approach to bar-prep.

1. Read the book [Fck the Bar](https://www.fckthebar.com), this has been the
  most helpful bar-prep advice book. It's half prep-talk, half practical
  advice, and it's short enough you can get through it one sitting.
2. Start doing practice problems. In California, the last few years of bar
  exams are [available
  here](http://www.calbar.ca.gov/Admissions/Examinations/California-Bar-Examination/Past-Exams).
  Nothing will supplant or come anywhere close to studying by practicing.
3. Practice our rule slapdowns via our [flashcards](/bar-prep/flashcards)
  app. This was not recommended by the Fck the Bar book, but it's something we
  find helpful, because we feel that memorizing the rules is the hardest part
  to bar prep.
