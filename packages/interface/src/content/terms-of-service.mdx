Welcome to Neon Law! This website (the “Site”) is owned and operated by Shook
Law PLLC (“Neon Law”, “us”, or “we”). Before you access or use the Site,
please read these Neon Law Legal Notices & Terms of Use (“Notices & Terms”)
fully and carefully, as they constitute a binding contract between you and
Neon Law with respect to your access and use of the Site.
‍
By accessing or using the Site, you acknowledge that you have read these
Notices & Terms and that you agree that these Notices & Terms will constitute
the entire agreement between you and Neon Law with respect to:

* your access and use of the Site and any of its features;
* any information or content, such as articles, blog posts, forms, templates,
  documents, or other materials (collectively, “Content”);
* any and all communications or submissions of information or materials made by
  you to Neon Law through the Site or otherwise (unless you are expressly
  informed otherwise by us).

Notwithstanding the above, if you have entered into an attorney-client
relationship with a lawyer on this platform pursuant to an executed
engagement letter, the terms of that engagement letter will govern in the
event of a conflict with these Notices & Terms.

Please review these Notices & Terms CAREFULLY, as they may have changed since
you last visited the Site.
‍
‍Neon Law may amend these Notices & Terms at any time in our sole discretion,
with or without notice to you. The latest version of the Notices & Terms will
always be posted on this page. When we amend these Notices & Terms, we will
update the Effective Date at the top of this page. Any such amendments to
these Notices & Terms will be effective as of the updated Effective Date. By
accessing or using the Site on or after the updated Effective Date, you
indicate to us that you accept and agree to the amended Notices & Terms.

### 1. Legal Notices.

1.1. No Legal Advice or Opinion. The Site and the Content (including without
limitation Content discussing legal issues or developments in the law) are
made available for general informational purposes only and are not intended
to constitute legal advice or a legal opinion or in any way to substitute for
specific advice from legal counsel. Because the applicability of any Content
is heavily dependent on the specific facts and context, and because the law
is constantly changing, Neon Law does not guarantee or warrant that any Content
is accurate or comprehensive. Neon Law is under no obligation to keep the
Content up-to-date. Please do not use the Content as the basis for any
decision and you should not act or refrain from acting based on any Content
without first consulting a qualified professional in the applicable law or
subject matter. You agree that your use of the Site and the Content is
entirely at your own risk.
‍
1.2. No Attorney-Client Relationship. You agree that your access and use of
the Site, including the submission of information to us through the Site,
does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and Neon Law.
Neon Law enters into attorney-client relationships with its clients only
pursuant to certain policies and procedures unrelated to the Site, including
the execution of an engagement letter, a screen for conflicts of interest,
and other Neon Law policies or rules of the Bar Associations in the states in
which we maintain offices. If you wish to inquire about Neon Law’s legal
services and how you might become a client of Neon Law, please contact us at
hello@.
‍
1.3. No Confidentiality. Unless you are an existing client of Neon Law, you
agree that any communications you initiate with Neon Law (including without
limitation any attorneys or employees affiliated with Neon Law) through the
Site (or otherwise, such as through email, telephone, voicemail, text
message, direct message, or any other communication) will not be treated as
confidential unless explicitly and specifically indicated otherwise. Unless
you are an existing client of Neon Law, you should not communicate any
information that is confidential, proprietary, or otherwise sensitive, and
Neon Law makes no guarantees or warranties with respect to the security,
confidentiality, use, disclosure, or return of any information we receive.
‍
1.4. No Advertising or Solicitation. The Site is not intended to be an
advertisement or solicitation.
‍
1.5. No Guaranteed Outcomes. The Content may contain descriptions of prior
matters or testimonials from current or former clients. Any descriptions or
testimonials on the Site are not intended to, and do not, guarantee future
successful outcomes, and do not imply Neon Law’s continued or current
representation of any clients identified.
‍
1.6. Authorized Jurisdictions. Neon Law attorneys are not authorized to
practice law in any jurisdiction for which they have not gained admission or
for which the rules of the Bar Associations in the states in which we
maintain offices do not provide applicable exceptions for attorneys pending
admission.
