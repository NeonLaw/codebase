> The following question comes from the California Committee of Bar Examiners.

Barn Exports hired Sam, an up-and-coming artist whose work was recently
covered in Modern Buildings Magazine, to paint a one-of-a-kind artistic
design along the border of the ceiling in its newly renovated lobby. After
discussing the work, Ed, the president of Barn, and Sam signed a mutually
drafted handwritten contract, which states in its entirety:

Sam shall paint a unique design along the entire ceiling border of all public
areas of the first-floor lobby. Barn shall pay $75,000 upon completion of the
work.

When Sam began work, he was surprised that the new plaster ceiling in the
lobby had not been sanded and sealed. Sam complained, but was told by Ed that
preparation was part of his responsibilities. Although Sam disagreed, he
spent four days sanding and sealing the ceiling. When Sam finished painting,
he submitted a bill for $78,000, having added $3,000 for labor and supplies
used in preparing the ceiling. In response, Barn sent a letter to Sam stating
that, because he had not painted the borders in the two public restrooms in
the lobby, no payment was yet due. Barn’s letter also stated that it had
recently spoken to several artists who perform similar work and learned that
“surface preparation” was typically the responsibility of the artist.

According to Sam, before the contract was signed, he told Ed that the
restrooms could not be included because his paints were not suitable for the
high humidity in those locations.

Sam sued Barn for breach of contract in the amount of $78,000.

Barn countersued for specific performance to have the borders in the
bathrooms painted.

1. Is Sam likely to prevail in his breach of contract lawsuit against Barn
  and if so, what damages will he likely recover? Discuss.
2. Is Barn likely to prevail in its lawsuit seeking specific performance
  against Sam? Discuss.

Sam (S) is to prevail that the contract was valid for $75,000 was valid, and
that he performed his part of the agreement.

First, S must prove that a legally enforceable agreement (K) exists. This
requires a showing of offer, acceptance, and consideration. The statute of
frauds does not factor into the K's validity since this is a service contract
that is not likely to take more than a year for S to perform on (paint the
ceiling). Here, S and Ed (E), the president of Barn (B), signed a mutually
drafted handwritten K. In that note, they detailed S's consideration, painting a
ceiling, and E's consideration, paying $75,000.
