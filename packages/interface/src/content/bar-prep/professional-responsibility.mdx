## Duty of Confidentiality

A lawyer cannot reveal information relating to the representation of a client
without the client's informed consent, except may, but is not required when:

* The disclosure is necessary to prevent death or substantial bodily harmed
  (ABA rules); or
* if the disclosure is necessary to prevent dath or substantial bodily harm,
  AND the lawyer made a good faith effort to persuade the client not to commit
  the criminal act and indicated to the client that they will have to report
  their conduct. (California).
