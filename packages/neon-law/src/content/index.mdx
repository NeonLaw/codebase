From bad credit to inter-generational wealth, [Neon Law](/about-us) is there to
help you along the way. We price our [debt
relief](/practice-areas/debt-relief) and
[bankruptcy](/practice-areas/bankruptcy) practice intentionally low
because we want to be your lawyer when you solve your money problems.

Once you have a handle on your finances, we can help you [buy a
home](/practice-areas/real-estate), [start and manage a
business](/practice-areas/small-business), and share your wealth with your friends
and family with an [estate](/practice-areas/estate-planning).

> Please [contact](/contact) or <a href="tel:1-415-969-3892">call</a> us if we
> can help with this journey.

Along your journey toward improving your life, we can help with other legal
issues that get in the way of living your best life. We have litigated to
protect [constitutional rights](/practice-areas/constitutional-rights),
[privacy and personal data](/practice-areas/cybersecurity-and-privacy), and
can assist with [family law matters so long as everyone works
together](/practice-areas/family-law).

Finally, and most importantly, we are proudest of our commitment to [pro
bono](/pro-bono) work and wish we could do it full time. If you require
assistance and have attained a
[SOLA](http://www.lacsnpro_bono.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SOLA-Process-Service-FAQ-2020.pdf)
