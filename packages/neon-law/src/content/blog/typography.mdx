We use the following, open-source fonts in our web applications and in our
writing. This website uses TTF files, which are gzipped in transit by Nginx.
We opt to use TTF files because we are required to produce PDF documents for
our clients.

adversarial letters such as cease and desist letters, settlement agreements,
and contracts, we use Charis.
