  The Open Technology Fund has been an incredible steward for
  privacy-protecting policies to ensure journalists world-wide can report the
  truth and humans everywhere can use a free Internet. We call on our
  government to continue these programs and to stop the current takeover by
  the Trump Administration.

A free and open press is the best check against totalitarian governments
because it provides truth in the face of propaganda. Since its inception in
2012, the Open Technology Fund, or OTF, has funded open-source
privacy-preserving projects like Signal, Tor, and SecureDrop. Journalists
have used these technologies to share and report facts in authoratarian
regimes. And LGBT and domestic violence victims have been able to share their
stories using OTF-sponsored applications without fear of government persecution.

Neon Law, through the [Save Internet

that OTF is irreperably harmed by the recent actions of the Trump
administration because people around the world cannot trust the OTF to be an
indepedent body.
