We use the following, open-source fonts in our web applications and in our
writing. This website uses TTF files, which are gzipped in transit by Nginx.
We opt to use TTF files because we are required to produce PDF documents for
our clients.

## Headings in Jost

## Website Copy in HK Grotesk

## Code in Fira Mono

## Legal Writing in Charis

For court correspondences, including motions, appeals, discover requests, and
adversarial letters such as cease and desist letters, settlement agreements,
and contracts, we use [Charis](https://software.sil.org/charis/).
