## A valid will

A valid will must be either:

* in writing, signed by the testator, and two uninterested witnesses at the
  same time. The two witnesses must acknowledge that the testator is indeed
  creating a will; OR
* in the handwriting of the testator, dated and signed. This is a holographic
  will.

### What can make a valid will invalid

The testator must be at least 18 and of sound mind. A will can be invalid if
the will was fradulently executed, either by inducement to create the will,
or fraud in preventing a testator to revoke the will (a testator can revoke a
will at any time).

#### Undue Influence

In California, undue influence requires excessive persuasion by someone who
causes another to act or refrain by overcomes to the testator's free will
free will which results in inequity.

You can prove undue influence by assessing:

* the testator's vulnerability
* the influencer's authority, AND
* the actions of influencer

Undue influence is presumed if:

* the testator is transferring their assets to the drafter
* the testator is in a fiduciary relationship with the influencer
* the influencer is a care custodian who has worked for testator for less than
  90 days, OR
* the influencer is a cohabitant or employee of the above people

Undue influence is not presumed if

* the beneficiary is a blood relative or cohabitant of the testator
* the property is valued at $5,000 or less,
* an indpendent attorney reviews the agreement and counsels the testator
  without the influencer present, OR
* clear and convincing evidence

#### Conflicts of Laws

A will is valid if it complies to the laws where the will was executed:

* where the testator is domiciled when it was executed
* the place where the will was executed, OR
* the place where the testator was domiciled at the time of death.

### Components of a Will

#### Integration

A will is made up of components that are integrated into the will that were
present at the time of its execution. This can be proven with extrinsic
evidence.

#### Incorporation by Reference

A document can be referenced in a will so long as it is sufficiently
described, e.g. "I declare that my house at 123 Main Street be included" and
it was written before the date of the will.

In California, a writing may be admitted that was not officially incorporated
so long as it was referred, dated, written or signed by the testator, and
sufficiently describes items where each item is less that $5,000 and the
total is less than $25,000.

#### Codicil

A codicil is an amendment to an existing will. A valid amendment must adhere
to the characteristics of a valid will. A codicil may be revoked
independently, whereas revoking a will also revokes all of its codicil. When
a codicil is created, the will is republicated on the date of the codicil, or
in other words, its effective date is the date of the codicil.

#### Pour Over Will

A pour over will is a document that states that all of the remaining assets
of a testator become property of a trust established in the will. The trust
must be identified and executed concurrently or before the creation of the
will.

### Revocation of a will

A will can be revoked by:

* A physical act
  * For instance burning or tearing a document
  * Crossing someone's name off the will
* Revocation by a subsequent will
  * This should be an explicit revocation but implied revocations are possible
* Revocation by an act of law
  * For instance, a new spouse or child may receive an intestate share unless
    expressly revoked.
* Dependent Relative Revocation
  * A situation where the testator revokes an original valid will on the
    mistaken belief that another will would be effective.

### Types of Gits

* Specific Gift
  * A specific gift is identifiable property, this can include stocks and
    dividends.
  * A specific gift is adeemed if it is no longer a part of the testator's
    assets when he passes. For instance if the testator wanted to give a ring
    to their child, and that ring was sold by the testator shortly before
    dying, that gift is void.
* Residuary Gift
  * A gift with the assets that are remaining over.
* Ademption by Satisfaction, occurs when a testator or the benefeciary declare
  in writing that a gift has been satisfied.

### Abatement

Abataement is the effect on gifts after the process of paying off the debts
of an estate. The order of gift abatement is:

* Property not included in the will
* Residuary gifts
* General, or non-specific gifts to non-relatives
* General gifts to relatives
* Specific gifts to non-relatives
* Specific gifts to relatives

### Lapse

Lapse happens when a beneficiary dies before the testator. When that happens
their gifts fall into residue, this is the same effect as if the testator
crossed out the beneficiary in a will.

Antilapse happens when the beneficiary is a relative of the testator or their
spouse and has descendants which can take their place.

If a beneficiary killed a testator, their gifts will lapse.

## Intestate Distribution

> In this section, "issue" is synonymous with descendants, and refers to
> children, grandchildren, etc.

* Community Property will revert to the surviving spouse.
* Separate Property
  * With a Spouse
    * And One Child or Parent
      * The Spouse takes half
    * And mare than one child or parent
      * The Spouse takes one third
  * The remaining property goes to the following categories with per capita, or
    equal division
    * The issue
      * Adopted chlidren count if the decedent was the adopter
      * Adopted chlidren count if the decedent had their child up for adoption
      * Foster or step children only count if the children where minors when
        the decedent became their foster/step-parent
    * The parents
    * The issue of parents
    * Grandparents
    * The issue of grandparents
    * The issue of a predeceased spouse
    * Parents of predeceased spouse
    * Issue of parents of predeceased spouse
  * If none of the above are found, the property will escheat to the state.

A survivor must survie the decedent by 120 hours. A survivor's share may be
considered an advancement or a share of their property if the decedent
declared that property as such in writing.

## Contracts in Wills

If two or more testators are coordinating their property in their wills,
contract law applies. The agreement must be proven by clear and convincing
evidence, signed by decedents, and be expressly referenced in a will.
