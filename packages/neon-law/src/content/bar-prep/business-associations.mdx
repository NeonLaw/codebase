## Corporations

### Corporate Formation

A corporation is a legal entity that exists separate from its owners. Owners
are shielded from personal liability, unless a court pierces the corporate
veil and disregards the corporate entity.

A corporation can be created by a *de jure corporation* or a *de factor
corporation*.

A de jure corporation follows all mandatory requirements by statute. At least
on incorporator must sign and file articles of incorporation including the
initial agent's name for the corporation, the street address, the authorized
number of shares, and the name and address of each incorporator.

A de facto corporation exists where there is a good faith, yet unsuccessful
attempt to incorporate.

### Piercing the Corporate Veil

A court can pierce the corporate veil and hold shareholders accountable if:

* the corporation is an alter ego of individual shareholders (e.g. funds are
  commingled);
* the shareholders did not put enough funds into the corporation to cover
  foreseeable debts;
* the corporation exists for the shareholders to commit fraud; and
* if a shareholder represents that they will be personally liable for corporate
  debts (estoppel)

Courts are more likely to pierce the corporate veil for tortious acts and not
for contractural ones.

### Company Purpose

A company can do pursue anything under the law, unless it has a narrow focus as
defined in its charter or by law. If a corporation with limited scope is acting
outside of that scope, an action for ultra vires can be filed. An ultra vires
act can be raised if 1) the act causes the state to seek dissolution, 2) the
corporation sues an officer, or 3) a shareholder sues to enjoin the act
outside this is of the scope.

### Corporate Shareholders and Stock

When a company is created, it must state how many shares are issued, and what
type of class those shares are in, such as preferred or common stock. Like any
contract, consideration is required in exchange for stock shares and can include
cash, debt relief, or work.

Before a company is formed, a promoter  can create pre-incorporation contracts
and is personally liable until there is a novation, or replacement of their
responsibility, usually by ways of the corporation agreement. A promoter has a
fiduciary relationship with a corporation.

### Corporation Management and Structure

A director and articles of incorporation are required for the state to recognize
a corporation. A corporation then has bylaws, which generally include how
officers are appointed, how they're voted on and how they can be removed. If
these provisions do not exist, the default rule is that a majority of
shareholders, or a majority of the board, can make these type of changes.

Aside from what is in the bylaws, a director or officer must act in good
faith in the best interests of the corporation, or the *business judgment
rule*, and a director or officer owes a duty of loyalty to the corporation. This
duty of loyalty extends to personal conflicts and situations where a director or
officer usurps a corporate opportunity.

Shareholders can make changes in a company, but only have indirect corporate
power, by having only the power to elect and remove members of the board and to
make fundamental changes in the corporate bylaws. A quorum, or majority of
shares, not shareholders, is required.

Shareholders can also bring direct or derivative, or on behalf of the
corporation, suits against the company. A derivative suit must be brought by
shareholder(s) that own stock at the time of the claim, adequately represent the
corporation, and have previously made a demand on the corporation's directors
to redress the injury.

Shareholders do not owe a fiduciary duty to the company, unless they're a
controlling shareholder, or someone who owns enough shares to make a meaningful
impact on the corporation.

### Federal Securities Law

#### Rule 16(b) No Short-Swing Profits

Any short-term profits of six months or less by a corporate insider that is
either an officer, director, or shareholder that owes more than 10% stock in the
corporation must be disgorged, or repayed to the corporation if the
corporation is listed or is worth more than $10MM with more than 2,000
shareholders.

#### Rule 10b-5 Insider Trading

Insider trading based on non-public corporate information is not permitted. To
prove insider trading, an insider must have intent or recklessness to commit
fraud, make a material representation or omission, and induce actual reliance on
misrepresentation in the purchase or sale of company assets (e.g. stock). In
order for federal jurisdiction to apply, Rule 10b-5 must apply to interstate
commerce. The remedy is that all profits must be disgorged to the company.

Examples of 10b-5 insider trading include:
  * Direct trading by an insider
  * Tippers (people who share improper information)
  * Tippees (people who receive improper information)
  * Misappropriators, or people who obtain corporate private information by
  other means, such as hackers.

#### Sarbanes-Oxley

If a company is publicly treated, Sarbanes-Oxley creates a board that oversees
public accounting firms that perform audits and update rules regarding financial
reporting, including:

* An audit board with work overseen by a registered public accounting firm
* A requirement that Senior Executives must take individual responsibility, and
* A requirement that the CEO and CFO must reimburse the company for inaccurate
  filings.

There are serious criminal penalties for violating this act including jail time
up to 25 years for actions like destroying or altering evidence. The Statute of
Limitations for Sarbones-Oxley violations is 2 years after discovery or 5 years
if the act wasn't discovered.

### Fundamental Changes

A fundamental change, such as a merger, share exchange, share conversion, or
dissolution, require a majority shareholder vote. The fundamental change is
reflected in the articles of incorporation, which is filed with the state. If a
shareholder is not in favor of the change, they may have the right to have the
corporation purchase their shares at fair market value (this is not available
for publicly traded companies).

If a company dissolves with debts, the Deep Rock doctrine applies. Third-party
creditors may be paid off before shareholder creditors.
