## Corporations

### Corporate Formation

A corporation is a legal entity that exists separate from its owners. Owners
are shielded from personal liability, unless a court pierces the corporate
veil and disregards the corporate entity.

A corporation can be created by a *de jure corporation* or a *de factor
corporation*.

A de jure corporation follows all mandatory requirements by statute. At least
on incorporator must sign and file articles of incorporation including the
initial agent's name for the corporation, the street address, the authorized
number of shares, and the name and address of each incorporator.

A de facto corporation exists where there is a good faith, yet unsuccessful
attempt to incorporate.

### Piercing the Corporate Veil

A court can pierce the corporate veil and hold shareholders accountable if:

* the corporation is an alter ego of individual shareholders (e.g. funds are
  commingled);
* the shareholders did not put enough funds into the corporation to cover
  foreseeable debts;
* the corporation exists for the shareholders to commit fraud; and
* if a shareholder represents that they will be personally liable for corporate
  debts (estoppel)

Courts are more likely to pierce the corporate veil for tortious acts and not
for contractural ones.

### Company Purpose

A company can do pursue anything under the law, unless it has a narrow focus as
defined in its charter or by law. If a corporation with limited scope is acting
outside of that scope, an action for ultra vires can be filed. An ultra vires
act can be raised if 1) the act causes the state to seek dissolution, 2) the
corporation sues an officer, or 3) a shareholder sues to enjoin the act
outside this is of the scope.

### Corporate Shareholders and Stock

When a company is created, it must state how many shares are issued, and what
type of class those shares are in, such as preferred or common stock. Like any
contract, consideration is required in exchange for stock shares and can include
cash, debt relief, or work.

Before a company is formed, a promoter  can create pre-incorporation contracts
and is personally liable until there is a novation, or replacement of their
responsibility, usually by ways of the corporation agreement. A promoter has a
fiduciary relationship with a corporation.

### Corporation Management and Structure

A director and articles of incorporation are required for the state to recognize
a corporation. A corporation then has bylaws, which generally include how
officers are appointed, how they're voted on and how they can be removed. If
these provisions do not exist, the default rule is that a majority of
shareholders, or a majority of the board, can make these type of changes.

Aside from what is in the bylaws, a director or officer must act in good
faith in the best interests of the corporation, or the *business judgment
rule*, and a director or officer owes a duty of loyalty to the corporation. This
duty of loyalty extends to personal conflicts and situations where a director or
officer usurps a corporate opportunity.

Shareholders can make changes in a company, but only have indirect corporate
power, by having only the power to elect and remove members of the board and to
make fundamental changes in the corporate bylaws. A quorum, or majority of
shares, not shareholders, is required.

Shareholders can also bring direct or derivative, or on behalf of the
corporation, suits against the company. A derivative suit must be brought by
shareholder(s) that own stock at the time of the claim, adequately represent the
corporation, and have previously made a demand on the corporation's directors
to redress the injury.

Shareholders do not owe a fiduciary duty to the company, unless they're a
controlling shareholder, or someone who owns enough shares to make a meaningful
impact on the corporation.
