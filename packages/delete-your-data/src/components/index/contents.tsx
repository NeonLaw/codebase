        Our team of lawyers make data deletion requests on your behalf based on
        your jurisdiction. For instance, if you&apos;re in Europe, we will make
        data deletion requests under the GDPR, if you&apos;re in Nevada, we will
        use the Nevada Privacy Act.{' '}

        We use industry-standard encryption and best software practices to keep
        your data safe. While we can&apos;t guarantee your data is 100% safe
        (and frankly, <strong>no one</strong> can), we can guarantee we&apos;re
        doing everything we can.

        Of course, our code is{' '}
        <a href="https://github.com/neonlaw/codebase" target="_blank">
          open source
        </a>{' '}
        so you can verify that our use of PostgreSQL cascading foreign keys
        deletes your data, and our logging code does not log any PII you ever
        added to our system. The only thing we can&apos;t do is continue to
        delete your data after you delete your account. Therefore, if you delete
        your account before the 1-year expiration, you must then create a new
        one for us to delete your data.
