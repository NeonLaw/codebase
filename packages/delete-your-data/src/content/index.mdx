Do you want you take back your personal data that you have shared with
software vendors? [We can help][].

For five dollars, we will make data deletion requests for you for 1 year, after
which we will delete your account - **NO MATTER WHAT**. If you want a new
account, you can of course, decide to create another 1-year account.

[Get started today][].

## FAQ

### How can I start?

E-mail us at support@neonlaw.com.

### How do you do this?

Our team of lawyers make data deletion requests on your behalf based on your
jurisdiction. For instance, if you're in Europe, we will make data deletion
requests under the GDPR, if you're in Nevada, we will use the Nevada Privacy
Act. [For a full list of jurisdictions, click here][].

### Is my data safe?

We use industry-standard encryption and best software practices to keep your
data safe. While we can't guarantee your data is 100% safe (and frankly, **no
one** can), we can guarantee we're doing everything we can.

### Can I delete my data from deleteyourdata.com?

Of course, our code is [open source][] so you can verify that our use of
PostgreSQL cascading foreign keys deletes your data, and our logging code does
not log any PII you ever added to our system.

The only thing we can't do is continue to delete your data after you delete your
account. Therefore, if you delete your account before the 1-year expiration, you
must then create a new one for us to delete your data.
