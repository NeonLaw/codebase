Law students and new lawyers face unprecedented challenges in the wake of the
COVID crisis. Many have lost internships, clerkships, and job offers. But if
there is something every new lawyer needs, it's experience. This website aims
to help with that.

Our goal is to support law students and law grads who are struggling to gain
meaningful experience and opportunities right now.

Here you will find resources, links, and advice about networking smartly,
preparing your job application materials, learning new skills legal employers
care about, and much more. We are adding new resources all the time. So check
back regularly.
