A collection of advice from attorneys:

"There’s nothing that can help you right now as much as networking. Resumes are unlikely to find you a job."

"Reach out to your resources. Professors. Former employers. Whoever can get you the ear of someone doing what you want to do."

"Don’t shirk your application materials. Mistakes here make it really easy to take you off the pile."

"Look at this time as about getting experience, not fancy titles or firms. Experience will get you ready for the next opportunity."

### Ethics Hotline

If you are already barred, you can call your State Bar's ethics hotline.

For Nevada, you can call 702.382.2200 or toll-free at 800.254.2797.
