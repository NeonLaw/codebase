      <h2>Rickie&abpos;s Story of His Wrongful Conviction</h2>

      <p>
        Rickie Lamont Slaughter is an innocent man who is serving a prison
        sentence for a crime he did not commit.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2004, a man along with some of his friends and family was robbed
        at, gunpoint, and unfortunately, that man was shot in the face. The
        victim said two men black men, with Jamaican accents, one 5 foot 6
        inches, and one 5, foot 10 perpetrated the crime and took \$1500 in
        cash, various credit cards, and items of clothing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Based on an unfair and faulty photo line-up, Rickie (who does not
        have a Jamaican accent and is 5&apos;8") was misidentified.
        Additionally, witnesses described the perpetrators' vehicle as being
        a Pontiac Grand Am, a different kind of car than the one Rickie
        possessed, a Ford Taurus. Furthermore, there was no physical evidence
        of the cash, credit cards, or clothing, to link him to the crime.
        Despite obvious flaws in the case, Rickie was still eventually
        wrongfully convicted at trial due to the photo misidentifications.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, new evidence in a federal proceeding regarding Rickie&apos;s
        conviction has brought to light that the prosecutor knowingly
        withheld evidence that could have proved Rickie&apos;s innocence.
        There was a second, more fair photo line-up from which Rickie was not
        identified as a perpetrator by the victims and witnesses and a 911
        dispatch report revealing what time the perpetrators left which was
        at 7:11pm. At that time, Rickie was picking up his girlfriend from
        work on the opposite side of town at the same time the crime was
        ending nearly 9 miles away proving that it was impossible for him to
        have committed the crime.

      </p>

      <p>
        In his [federal habeas appeal](/pdfs/rickie-2AP.pdf), Rickie detailed
        how the facts against him were unjust for several reasons:
      </p>

      <h3>
        The unfair photo line-up
      </h3>

      <p>
        During the police investigation, an unfair photo line-up was
        presented to, the victims and witnesses that caused them to
        misidentify Rickie.
      </p>

      <p>
        Specifically, the photo line-up was made in a way that caused
        Rickie&apos;s photo to stand out from the rest of the photos. The
        color and background was uniquely different from the other 5 photos
        in the line-up, which psychological made his picture stand out to the
        viewers. Psychologists and police protocols have long-warned about
        making one photo stand out from the rest because it can lead to
        misidentification. The investigation deliberately did not follow the
        proper protocols.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Innocence Project has an in-depth study of misidentification,
        which details how bias has been used to convict innocent people of
        crimes they did not commit.

      </p>

      <h3>
        New evidence of a second more fair photo line-up
      </h3>

      <p>
        At a recent hearing, ordered by a federal judge, the now-retired lead
        detective in this case, Jesse Priedo (who retired after wrongly
        accusing 15 year old Patrick Wayne Harper of a crime that he was
        later exonerated for) testified for the first time ever that a second
        more fair line-up was shown to the witnesses in 2004. In that
        instance <em>no one picked Rickie out of this more fair line-up</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, this information was not adequately provided to
        Rickie&apos;s attorney before trial, and the jury did not hear about
        this second more fair photo line-up. Police did not promptly preserve
        this photo line up as evidence. Hearing about this second more fair
        photo line-up, would have undermined the first unfair photo line-up
        and Rickie would likely have been acquitted had the jury heard this.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rickie deserves a trial where this evidence can be presented to the
        jury.

      </p>
      <h3>
        New evidence of when the perpetrators left the crime scene and the
        prosecutor&apos;s deception
      </h3>

      <p>
        At Rickie&apos;s trial, a big issue was what time did the
        perpetrators leave the crime scene. This was an important question
        because Rickie&apos;s girlfriend testified that Rickie picked her up at
        7:15 pm, 9 miles away from the crime scene. Additionally, an
        investigator drove the fastest route possible between the crime scene
        and where Rickie&apos;s girlfriend worked to determine the fastest time it
        would take to drive that route. The fastest route was 20 minutes.
      </p>

      <p>
        At trial, the prosecutor secured a court ruling requiring that the
        jury be told that the perpetrators left the crime scene at 7 pm.
        However, new evidence (a 911 dispatch report, which was withheld by
        police and prosecutors all these years) proves that the perpetrators
        actually left the crime scene at 7:08 pm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Specifically, the call came in at 7:11 pm and the caller is
        documented as having stated to the dispatch operator that the crime
        had happened 5 minutes ago. This statement was made one minute and 48
        seconds into the call, which means that the statement was made at
        7:12 pm. The dispatch report documents this as t/l 5 minutes ago,
        which means that the time-lapse of the crime was 5 minutes ago.
        Simple subtraction of 7:12 pm minus 5 minutes means that the
        perpetrators left between 7:07 and 7:08 pm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, the now-retired detective testified at a new hearing
        that a witness who was the boss of Rickie&apos;s then-girlfriend
        originally stated that he had left work at 7:15 pm. This statement
        combined with the fact that he stated that he saw Rickie as he was
        pulling out of the parking lot means that Rickie must have been there
        at his girlfrien&apos;s place of work at 7:15 pm, 9 miles (or 20 minutes
        away) from the crime scene. At trial, the prosecutors knowingly hid
        this statement from Ricki&apos;s girlfrien&apos;s boss from the jury.
      </p>

      <p>
        This new information means that Rickie could not be one of the
        perpetrators at the crime scene.
      </p>

      <p>
        As such, the fact Rickie arrived at 7:15 to pick up his girlfriend at
        715 North Nellis Blvd means he could not have perpetrated the crime
        because the earliest it would have taken a perpetrator to drive from
        2612 Glory View would have been 7:28-7:30. This new evidence
        demonstrates Rickie&apos;s need for a new trial to show the jury the
        evidence of his actual innocence. The fact that the prosecutor misled
        the jury at trial into believing that the perpetrators fled the crime
        scene at 7:00 (and at the same time corruptly withheld a dispatch
        report that showed the contrary) is significant because it changed
        the actual timing of the event to favor the prosecutor&apos;s
        fictionalized version and caused Rickie to be wrongly convicted of a
        crime he did not commit.
