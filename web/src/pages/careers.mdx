Neon Law is a place where the group matters so much more than the individual.
Here, we celeberate team wins, we always work together, and we will never
talk behind your back. We run our business transparently to solely focus on
[our mission of advancing access to justice as much as possible](/values)
because life is short, and we'd rather not waste our time with anything but
our mission.

We are looking for progressive attorneys, software engineers, and social
workers or people with high EQ to join our firm to maintain and grow
our attorney-client relationships with our amazing clients.

Since we optimize for justice, we don't optimize for salary. Everyone's
salary is shared amongst our firm and is capped at five times the minimum
wage in your locale. We believe instead of individual pay, we
should focus more on long-term communal benefits. We pay for family
healthcare, 401k deposits, FSA deposits, 529 plan deposits, and student loan
reimbursement for _all_ members of our firm, irrespective if they are an
attorney or not.

Additionally, we strive to be great stewards of our community - we invite you to
check out our [pro bono](/pro-bono) efforts and if you have an idea on how we
can better improve our community, we're all ears. If you join us, we want to
empower you to be the best steward of your community.

_Neon Law is an equal opportunity employer. We value a diverse workforce and
an inclusive culture. Neon Law encourages applications from all qualified
individuals without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation,
gender identity or expression, age, national origin, marital status,
citizenship, disability, veteran status and record of arrest or conviction, or
any other characteristic protected by law._

_Neon Law will make every effort to ensure that its recruitment and
employment provide all qualified persons, including persons with
disabilities, with full opportunities for employment in all positions._
