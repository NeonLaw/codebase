Delete Your Data is a SaaS offering offered by Neon Law. While you can certainly
delete your data across the Internet yourself, our offering is unique for many
of reasons, a few of which are listed below.

## We have to act in your best interest as long as you hire us

Attorneys are held to a high ethical standard mandated by law when dealing with
your personal information. We're not some no-name company with people who can
hide behind fake names, foreign companies, and arbitration clauses, we're real
lawyers who will zealously fight for your rights so long as there is an
attorney-client relationship.

## We have already done this before

Instead of figuring out what you need to send to whom, we can do this for you
after you answer questions on just DeleteYourData.com

## We are always on the lookout for more services to integrate.

With an ever-increasing library of services which you can delete your data from,
our team tirelessly scours the Internet for companies who may have your
information and laws which can govern and mandate those companies to keep your
personal information safe.

## Get Started Today

You can get started today by signing up for an account. After we walk through
the process of establishing an attorney-client relationship, we will send data
deletion requests on your behalf. If we do not currently integrate with a
service, please let us know and we will look into it.
