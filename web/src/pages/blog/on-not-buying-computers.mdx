The great thing about cloud computing is that you can rent very powerful
computers by the second. Additionally, our cloud provider, Google Cloud
Platform, has made a [commitment to
sustainability](https://sustainability.google/progress/projects/announcement-100/#:~:text=I'm%20thrilled%20to%20announce,our%20data%20centers%20and%20offices.&text=Today%2C%20we%20are%20the%20world's,of%20wind%20and%20solar%20energy.)
that is awe-inspiring and caused us to re-examine our own computer use.

Traditionally, we have used "personal computers" or PCs since the 90s. Every
few years, the PC specs would improve so much that it became prudent to invest
in a new one. Nowadays, what someone can rent in the cloud is so much more
powerful than what someone can buy. This has insipred us to think, can we move
all of our computing to the cloud? This way, we'll never need a PC that's
capable of more than HD videostreaming. In other words, we can replace our
computers with something like an AppleTV, Amazon Fire TV, or Google
Chromecast and then connect to computers (e.g. through the VNC protocol)
within our cloud to handle client matters.

Not only is this a more environmentally friendly option to compute, it is also a
secure one as well. For the highest security measures, a company can create a
[Panopticon](https://ethics.org.au/ethics-explainer-panopticon-what-is-the-panopticon-effect/#:~:text=The%20panopticon%20is%20a%20disciplinary,not%20they%20are%20being%20watched.),
where every time an employee logs onto a cloud computing station, every action
is tracked. While of course privacy is important, employers should understand
that the needs of the business outweigh. And frankly, no one should be looking
at porn, or visiting any unapproved website for that matter on company
workstations anyway.
