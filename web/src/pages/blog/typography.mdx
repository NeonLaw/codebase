We use the following, open-source fonts in our web applications and in our
writing. This website uses WOFF2 files.  We also host TTF versions of these
files on this website to accommodate for older browsers and PDFs, which is the
standard format we use for legal correspondences.

## Headings in Jost

For our headings like the "Headings in Jost" heading above, we use [Jost by
indestructable type](https://indestructibletype.com/Jost.html).

## Website Copy in HK Grotesk

For our regular text, we use [HK Grotesk by
Hanken](https://hanken.co/products/hk-grotesk).

## Code in Fira Mono

```txt
For code blocks, we use Fira Mono, a font produced for and used by Mozilla.
```

[Check out Fira Mono at its repository
homepage](https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/)

## Legal Writing in Charis

<span>
For court correspondences, including motions, appeals, discovery requests, and
adversarial letters such as cease and desist letters, settlement agreements,
and contracts, we use&nbsp;
<a href="https://software.sil.org/charis/" target="_blank">
Charis developed by SIL International
</a>. This is a wonderful font with support for languages around the world.
