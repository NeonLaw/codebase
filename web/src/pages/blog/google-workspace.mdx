Our company uses Google Workspace for email, calendar, and docs.

### Admin configuration

Since we do not use all of Google Workspace, we turn off the apps we do not use
[here](https://admin.google.com/ac/appslist/core) and only turn on Calendar,
Drive, Gmail, and Google Meet.

### Multi-Factor Authentication

At Neon Law, client confidentiality is of the upmost importance and MFA is a
very necessary step in improving our security. We use [these
settings](https://admin.google.com/ac/security/2sv) to apply MFA to all users.
New user accounts have one week to enable MFA before they are locked out.

### Organizational Units

We define organizational units which we can then define more refined rules like
email delivery defined below. We currently have organizational units for
`lawyers` and `clerks`.

### Email

Only lawyers of our law firm can send outbound email. This means that all other
staff can only send emails to internal Neon Law users, or users with a
`@neonlaw.com` email address. We accopmlish this with [these
settings](https://support.google.com/a/answer/2640542)
in Google Workplace that add restrictions to outbound email addresses to an
orginazitonal unit, like the `clerks` organizational unit defined above.
