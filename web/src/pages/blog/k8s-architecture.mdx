The above diagram, generated
[here](https://github.com/NeonLaw/codebase/blob/main/diagrams/neon_diagrams/k8s_diagram.py),
details our Kubernetes clusters. We maintain two, one for staging and one for
production. Each cluster is deployed on GKE in the Las Vegas region in its own
GCP project.

In the diagram above, we highlight the production GKE cluster and the processes
deployed from packages built in this repo or vendor-managed software. Let's
traverse this diagram starting from the Load Balancer, which is where users
interface with Neon Law software.

The Load Balancer is managed by Google Cloud. By enforcing all ingress traffic
to funnel through the Load Balancer we can leverage the benefits of this managed
service including SSL encryption, WAF, and CDN support.

### Kubernetes Ingress
Kubernetes Ingress within our cluster is managed by Nginx, which is installed
with its Helm Chart and managed in our Terraform scripts. With the Nginx helm
chart installed, we can define various ingress files to map incoming DNS entries
with Kubernetes services.

We have two defined ingress rules, `@neonlaw/api` and `superset`.

### @neonlaw/api
This service points to a Kubernetes deployment we manage that serves our
[GraphQL API](https://api.neonlaw.com/graphiql). Please refer to the `./server`
directory of our [GitHub codebase](https://github.com/neonlaw/codebase) to learn
more about what this package does.

### Superset
This service points to a managed Apache Superset offering. Like Nginx and every
other external software ran in this Kubernetes cluster, it is installed with its
Helm chart and managed in our Terraform scripts. You can visit our Superset
instance at https://superset.neonlaw.com (our staging Superset exists at
https://superset.neonlaw.net).

Superset is an open-source business intelligence tool that provides us with
internal data snapshots and visualizations. In each Superset instance, we plug
in our datasources.

### Databases
We currently use Google Cloud's managed PostgreSQL offering. Everything else is
deployed in Helm Charts in our database. We use Neo4j, Elasticsearch and Kafka.
Each can be completely regenerated with data stored in our PostgreSQL database.

### Logging
We deploy Fluentd to collect STDOUT from each of our pods. Fluentd, then posts a
subset of these logs to Logflare which then saves that data longterm in
BigQuery and saves all of the logs in long-term storage in a separate GCP
Project for auditing.

### Authentication
Some of our applications depend on authentication tokens which we use Auth0 for.
After a user authenticates with Auth0, they have a limited-access token to
access some of our resources.
