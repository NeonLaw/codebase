The above diagram, generated
[here](https://github.com/NeonLaw/codebase/blob/main/diagrams/neon_diagrams/k8s_diagram.py),
details our Kubernetes clusters. We maintain two, one for staging and one for
production. Each cluster is deployed on GKE in the Las Vegas region in its own
GCP project.

In the diagram above, we highlight the production GKE cluster and the processes
deployed from packages built in this repo or vendor-managed software. Let's
traverse this diagram starting from the Load Balancer, which is where users
interface with Neon Law software.

The Load Balancer is managed by Google Cloud. By enforcing all ingress traffic
to funnel through the Load Balancer we can leverage the benefits of this managed
service including SSL encryption, WAF, and CDN support.

### Kubernetes Ingress
Kubernetes Ingress within our cluster is managed by GKE and GCP. This way we can
leverage GCP SSL Certs and IAP for accessing internal company resources.  We
have three defined ingress rules, `@neonlaw/api`, `Confluent Command Center` and
`superset`.

### @neonlaw/api
This service points to a Kubernetes deployment we manage that serves our
[GraphQL API](https://api.neonlaw.com/graphiql). Please refer to the `./server`
directory of our [GitHub codebase](https://github.com/neonlaw/codebase) to learn
more about what this package does.

### Confluent Command Center
This service points to our managed Kafka instance and the Confluent Command
Center which is used to analyze Kafka. You can visit this at
https://kafka.neonlaw.com or https://kafka.neonlaw.net.

### Superset
This service points to a managed Apache Superset offering. Like Neo4j and every
other external software ran in this Kubernetes cluster, it is installed with its
Helm chart and managed in our Terraform scripts. You can visit our Superset
instance at https://superset.neonlaw.com (our staging Superset exists at
https://superset.neonlaw.net).

Superset is an open-source business intelligence tool that provides us with
internal data snapshots and visualizations. In each Superset instance, we plug
in our datasources.

### Databases
We currently use Google Cloud's managed PostgreSQL offering. Everything else is
deployed in Helm Charts in our database. We use Neo4j, Elasticsearch and Kafka.
Each can be completely regenerated with data stored in our PostgreSQL database,
except for files in Blob Storage.

### Blob Storage
We use Google Cloud Storage Buckets to store files. All access to this blob
storage is stored in a separate GCP Audit account so we have a full accounting
of who saw what file. This is important for conflicts.

### Logging
We use Loglare to collect hooks from pods and post them to BigQuery.  We also
use Logflare as a server for Webhooks for ingesting third-party data.

### Authentication
Some of our applications depend on authentication tokens which we use Auth0 for.
After a user authenticates with Auth0, they have a limited-access token to
access our service-based deployments.

### Non-Service Deployments

Deployments without services listen to changes in one of our Databases, namely
Kafka and process data there. These include our `worker` and `email` processes.
