On Question 4 of the bar exam, I (a lawyer at Neon Law), received a [52.5 on my
essay](/pdfs/2020-bar-prep-results.pdf) for a [pretty bad
essay](/pdfs/question-4-bad-answer.pdf). This blog post will examine where I
went wrong compared to the [model answer](/pdfs/question-4-model-answer.pdf) so
I don't repeat those mistakes.

## Analyzing the Question

This question is about a conspiracy, an actual burglary/robbery, and the
subsequent rights of the accused in a photo lineup.

### Mistake #1, not separating the charges from the defenses

The question asked was:

> 1. With what crime or crimes, if any, may Al reasonably be charged; what
> defenses, if any may he reasonably assert; and what is the likely outcome?
> Discuss.

Here, the bar examiners clearly layed out a format I should have used. First,
talk about the crimes, then the defenses, then examine the likelihood that the
defendants would be charged. On my essay, I sporadically included both crimes
and defenses and did not clearly signpost as is expected by the bar examiners.

### Mistake #2, not detailing criminal conspiracy

Clearly, I did not have a strong understanding of crimes, especially the crime
of conspiracy, which was a big chunk of the points on this test. To effectively
argue for conspiracy, I should have:

* Started with the common law definition of a "meeting of the minds"; then
* Moved on to the MPC definition which includes an "overt act"; then
* Included the Pinkerton rule which has a four-prong test about assessing
  whether a co-conspirator is liable for foreseeable substantive crimes; then
* Assessed whether a co-conspirator withdrew from the conspiracy

In the model answers, each step above is mentioned with facts from the question
to support claims that a conspiracy had taken place. I know I missed the ball
completely when I did not mention an "overt act" which here could have been
twofold, both driving to the house at midnight **and** the actual breaking and
entering of the victim's house.

### Mistake #3, not detailing larceny, robbery, and burglary

These three crimes are distinct, yet intermingled when it comes to answering a
crimes question. It is most likely that if asked about one, I'd be asked about
all three and should plan accordingly.

* Larceny is the taking and moving of another person's property without their
  consent with the intent to deprive them of it permanently
* Robbery is larceny from another person's presence or person through threat or
  intimidation.
* Burglary is the breaking and entering into a dwelling with the intent to
  commit a felony inside. While common law required the breaking and entering to
  have happened at nighttime, the MPC does not.

Had I known these three crimes like I should have, I could have gone through
each and proved caused for larceny, no cause for robbery (there was no threat),
and cause for burglary because there was the intent to commit larceny.

### Mistake #4, not analyzing a withdrawal from a conspiracy and withdrawal as accomplice

As discussed above, there is a formulaic way to answer conspiracy questions.
When it comes to withrdawal, I should have mentioned whether an "overt act" to
withdraw had taken place and the fact that it was too late for Al in this
question to have withdrawn from the conspiracy the moment he stepped foot into
the victim's house.

### Mistake #5, not answering just the question

The second question of the bar **only** asked whether or not the lineup
identification could be suppressed. I included stuff that did not answer that,
which is confusing to the grader and shows a clear understanding that I did
*not* know the question I was being asked.

### Mistake #6, not beginning a constitutional law question with "State Action"

When speaking about constitutional law questions, I should always begin with
State Action. This frames any constitutional law discussion appropriately. For a
5th Amendment question I could have started with:

> State Action
>
> The 5th and 14th Amendment of the US Constitution protects people against
> state action. In this case, there is clear state action because the issue here
> involves the police who are state actors.

### Mistake #7, not knowing the rule for lineups.

The rule for lineups is "police cannot use lineups that are **impermissibly
suggestive** that have a **substantial likelihood of resulting in
misidentification**." If the lineup is **still reliable**, it can be used
irrespective of any impermissive suggestions. There are three points I should
have addressed.

Here, the key terms I missed the standard completely, and
had I signposted both impermissively suggestive and substantial likelihood of
resulting in misidentification, I would have clearly shown the graders I knew
the rule and applied the facts appropriately.

## For Next Time

Aside from a better understanding of the law, I could have done a much better
job at simple reading comprehension. These are mistakes I will work at to not
make again.
