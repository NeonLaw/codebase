Fired because of Discrimination? How to File A Discrimination Claim

California is at-will employment state. This means that an employer can fire
you for no reason. However, an employer can not fire you for illegal
discrimination.

Illegal discrimination happens when you are fired because of your race,
religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability,
mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status,
sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, or
veteran; or military status of any person.

If you believe you have experienced illegal discrimination, these are the
steps to file a discrimination claim:

1. Put together all evidence in a file/folder (texts, emails, pictures, list
  of witnesses, social media posts, names and contact information for every
  person involved).
2. You have two filing options:
  a. You can file with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (CDFEH); or
  b. You can file your claim directly in Court.

3. Filling with CDFEH:
  a. File your claim on-line at the CDFEHâ€™s website; or
  b. File your claim by mail by filling out this form; or
  c. You can file your claim by phone at 1-800-884-1684.

4. Filing with the Court:
  a.You must first get the Right-to-Sue from CDFEH
    i. Create an account with CDFEH;
    ii. File the Right-to-Sue form using that account;
    iii. Once CDFEH certifies your Right-to-Sue, you can file your claim in Court.
  b.Choose the Court for your claim
    i. Follow all State court rules if you file in a State court;
    ii. Follow all Federal court rules if you file in Federal court;
    iii. Follow all local rules (each court has them, look at their
      individual website)
