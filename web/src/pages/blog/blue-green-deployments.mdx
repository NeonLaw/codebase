Since we have a narrowly defined architecture of just stateless Kubernetes
deployments, GCP Pub/Sub, and GCP Cloud Functions we follow these blue/green
deployment practices for zero-downtime deployments.

> Check out our [Versions Terraform module](https://github.com/NeonLaw/codebase/blob/main/infrastructure/versions/main.tf)!

1. Our stateless Kubernetes servers only have one version deployed per project.
  These services interact with the `green` version of our schema and serverless
  microservices.
2. Our schemas and functions are deployed with both the `green` and `blue`
  schemas. These deployments are named with their version in Terraform so a
  versioned schema or function deploy can switch between `green` and `blue` with
  Terraform needing to destroy and recreate the deployment.
3. When publishing a new schema, we first deploy it as the `blue` version. Then
  after the schema and functions have successfully deployed, we then take that
  same hash map and turn it into the `green` version, and take the current
  `green` version and make it the `blue` version. The `blue` version is reserved
  for rollbacks if needed, and will cease to exist when creating the next
  versioned `blue` deployment for release.
