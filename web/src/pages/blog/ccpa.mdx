The California Consumer Privacy Act gives consumers the right to have personal
information deleted on request to companies which fit the criteria under the
Act. Companies subject to the Act don’t need to be based in California - simply
gross more than $25 million annually, have data on more than 50,000 California
residents, or receive more than half their income through the sale of personal
information. California has a broad definition of personal information, and it’s
important to know information is being collected so consumers can make informed
decisions about the privacy of their data.

Under the CCPA, personal information is any information which could identify a
consumer. The CCPA includes 11 categories of “information that identifies,
relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably
be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.”
(CCPA § 1798.140)

This means that both objective statements, like the color of someone’s eyes, and
subjective statements, like opinions or assessments, are considered personal
information. The information doesn’t even need to be true - it just needs to be
data which is associated with or could identify a consumer.

Personal information extends to information which a consumer may not expect to
be personal data at all. Data as defined in the CCPA as having no medium or
format limitation, meaning that pictures and sounds could qualify as personal
information as well as text, biometric and other electronic information.

The full text of the Act is available on the website for the California
legislature. Here are some examples of what information is collected - and can
be deleted - under the CCPA:

### Direct Identifiers

The most obvious forms of personal information collected under the CCPA are
direct identifiers. These include a consumer’s name, address and identification
numbers. Also included is another class, defined as unique customer identifiers.
A unique personal identifier is data which could identify an individual
consumer, family or device “over time and across services.” In our technology
age, these personal identifiers can take many forms. Some examples include IP
address, cookies, beacons, pixel tags, mobile ad identifiers, customer numbers,
unique pseudonyms, unique aliases and telephone numbers.

* Name
* Alias
* Account name
* Mailing address
* Email address
* Social security number
* Driver’s license number
* Passport number
* Unique customer identifier

### Customer record information

* Signature
* Insurance policy number
* Education
* Employment
* Bank account number
* Credit card number
* Financial information
* Medical information
* Health insurance information
* Physical description or characteristics

### Characteristics which classify consumers as protected under California or federal law:

* Race
* Religion
* Sexual orientation
* Gender identify
* Gender expression
* Age

### Commercial information

* Personal property records
* Products/services purchased, obtained or considered
* Purchasing or consuming history or tendencies

### Biometric information

* Hair color
* Eye color
* Fingerprints
* Height
* Retinal scans
* Facial recognition
* Voice
* Other biometric data

### Internet and other electronic network activity

* Browsing history
* Search history
* Website, advertisement and application  interaction/engagement data

### Geolocation data

### Audio, visual, thermal, olfactory, electronic or similar information

### Professional and employment-related information

### Educational information

Educational information under the CCPA is described as any information which
isn’t publicly available, as defined by the California Family Educational Rights
and Privacy Act (20 U.S.C. section 1232g, 34 C.F.R. Part 99).

### Inferences

The CCPA also provides protection for information which may indirectly describe
a consumer through unique characteristics. In addition to concrete data points,
the CCPA also covers inferences drawn from personal information and customer
profiles. For example, a company creates a customer profile based on ads clicked
on which show preference for a particular product, and combines that information
with posts the consumer has interacted with to create an inference about a
person’s political leanings. Both the internet activity, the inference and the
consumer profile created would be considered personal information under the
CCPA.

Examples of inferences include:

* Preferences
* Characteristics
* Predispositions
* Attitudes
* Intelligence
* Psychological trends
* Behavior
* Abilities
* Aptitudes

### What isn’t personal information?

Information which is available publicly isn’t included in the CCPA’s definition
of personal information. Information made public through records at the federal,
state or local government levels aren’t covered by the CCPA. As well, some types
of information are excluded, such as certain financial information and medical
information regulated by the Health Information Portability and Accountability
Act (HIPAA).

De-identified information or aggregated and de-identified information is also
considered not to be personal information, provided it can’t be reasonably tied
to an individual. The Act also doesn’t cover information about multiple users in
aggregate, aside from households.

## So, what can be deleted?

Under the CCPA, consumers may request that any personal information a company
stores about them be deleted. This is referred to as the global option, though a
business may offer consumers the option to only delete certain data.

## What can’t be deleted?

Under the Act, there are several exceptions which a business may cite in order
to retain a consumer’s personal information. These exceptions include personal
information:

* Required to complete the transaction the information was originally provided
  for
* Required to protect against and prosecute malicious or illegal activity
* Needed to identify and correct errors in software
* Required to exercise or protect free speech
* Collected in compliance with California Electronic Communications Privacy Act
* Required for scientific, historial or statistical research which benefits the
  public good
* Used internally to fulfill the expectations of the customer based on the
  customer’s business relationship with the company
* Required to comply with a legal operation
