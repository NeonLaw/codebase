We consider files grouped data that is not stored in our primary PostgreSQL
database, such as images, Microsoft Word documents, PDF files, audio and video.
This blog post will go over how we capture user uploads, store the files on our
server, and render them to users.

## Designing a Data Model

We have two different type of files in our system, `ResponseDocuments` or
files that our clients upload in response to questions we ask them and
`MatterDocuments` or files that we upload for our clients when providing
legal advice. If you have read our [blog post about
authorization](/blog/authorization), `portal` users can upload documents in
response to a question, and `lawyer` and `admin` users can upload matter
documents. This is enforced with a PostgreSQL `check` before creating either
record.

## Storage in GCP Buckets

We maintain two GCP buckets for storing files, one for unprocessed uploads that
any user can upload to and one for storing the files after they have been
processed by our server.

### Unprocessed Uploads Bucket

Uploaded documents in the unprocessed folder are deleted after 2 hours from
when it was uploaded. A filename in this bucket is the `base64` encoding of
the `uploadURL` created from Transloadit.

### Private Assets Bucket

After a document is processed by our server, we copy the file from the
unprocessed uploads folder to our private assets bucket. Each file follows
the format `matters/${matterId}/filename` or
`responses/${responseId}/filename`.

You may have correctly guessed that `MatterDocuments` are stored in the form of
`matters/${matterId}/filename` and `ResponseDocuments` are stored in the form of
`responses/${responseId}/filename`.

## File Uploads

We use Transloadit to process file uploads from our application. Our upload
process is two HTTP requests. First, a HTTP POST request is made to Transloadit
to upload our file to its server. Second, with the `uploadURL` returned from
`Transloadit`, a user sends a GraphQL mutation request to our API to create a
`response_document` or `matter_document` with either the
`createResponseDocument` or `createMatterDocument` mutation respectively.

### Choose a Transloadit Template and `getTransloaditToken`

### Upload to Transloadit

After you upload a file to Transloadit, Transloadit will return an `uploadURL`
in the response body. This `uploadURL` is what is sent to `react-hook-form`.

### After Transloadit Processes the File, the `Unprocessed Upload` Bucket

### Create a Matter Document or Response Document
