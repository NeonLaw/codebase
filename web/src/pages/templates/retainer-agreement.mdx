Re: <Interpolation text={matter.shortDescription} />

Dear <Interpolation text={matter.primaryContact.name} />:

Thank you for selecting Neon Law to represent you with respect to:
<Interpolation text={matter.description} />

This letter will confirm our recent discussion regarding the scope and terms
of our engagement.

Our firm has agreed to represent you in the described matter above. While I
will be personally supervising this legal matter, I anticipate that other
lawyers and legal assistants in the firm will also be working on this matter.

We will undertake the following work on your behalf:
<Interpolation text={matter.undertaking} />

## Payment and Invoicing

You have agreed to pay for our services based on the time we spend working on
the case. My current hourly rate is <Interpolation text={matter.primaryAttorney.hourlyRate} />.
The rates of our associates currently range between $200 and $300 per hour.
Legal assistants, who will be utilized where appropriate to avoid unnecessary
attorney fees are charged at $100 per hour. These rates are subject to change
once a year, usually in December. Generally you will be billed for all time
spent on your matter, including telephone calls and emails.

## Arbitration

Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity
thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this
agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in <Interpolation text={matter.jurisdiction} />&nbsp;
before three arbitrators. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS
pursuant to its [Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and
Procedures](https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/)
and in accordance with the
[Expedited Procedures in those Rules](https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/#Rule-16-1).
Judgment on the Award may be entered in
<Interpolation text={matter.jurisdictionCourt} />&nbsp;
This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in
aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

The parties agree that, wherever practicable, they will seek to appoint a
fair representation of diverse arbitrators (considering gender, ethnicity and
sexual orientation), and will request administering institutions to include a
fair representation of diverse candidates on their rosters and list of
potential arbitrator appointees.

## No Guarantee

I, Neon Law, or any of our associates cannot guarantee a successful
conclusion in any case. However, we will use our best efforts on your behalf.

## Associate Counsel

Client agrees that the Firm may, at the Firm's option, participate in a
division of fees in this case and assume joint responsibility for the
representation of the Client, either in the event that the Firm retains
associate counsel or that Client later chooses new counsel, provided that the
total fee to the Client does not increase as a result of this division of
fees and that the attorneys involved have agreed to the division of fees and
assumption of joint responsibility.

## Collection of Unpaid Fees

In the event that Client or Third Party fails to pay the fees agreed to in
this agreement, Firm is authorized to make all lawful collections efforts,
including, but not limited to, the use of a collections agency. Client agrees
to pay all attorneys fees and costs associated with any collection efforts.
Client further agrees that in order to collect any overdue amounts, Firm may
disclose information regarding Client's case and Client waives any
confidentiality they may have so that Firm may do so.

## Thank You

On behalf of Neon Law, I am looking forward to representing you in this
matter. If you have any questions, please contact me at your earliest
convenience.
