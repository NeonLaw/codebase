Estate planning is a way to create an entity to manage your possessions and
those of your friends and family should they opt in. They are a great vehicle
to plan for life after death because none of the possessions in an estate are
subject to the probate process.

If you have questions about a legal dilemna, or just need someone to chat
with (we get it, we're lonely to), please book a
[30-minute consultation with us](/contact).
