Neon Law in no way condones slavery or human trafficking in any form. We will
always be transparent in how we choose vendors and will continue to work hard
to ensure none of our suppliers engage in such actions. You can read about
some of the vendors we work with on our [blog](/blog), and in the small
chance you know these vendors have been aiding and abetting slavery or human
trafficking, please contact us so we can remedy this situation as fast as
possible.

If you or someone you know has been involved in these heinous business
practices, reach out to us. If we can, we'll help in any way possible to
bring the perpetrators to justice.
