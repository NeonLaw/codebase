Rickie Slaughter is a prolific black spoken-word poet who is currently
incarcerated but dreams of creating a quality audio podcast platform in which
he can create, protect, and publish creative works of original spoken word art
and written poetry as well as other types of creative, expressive art.
His perspective is unique, raw, and profoundly insightful. You can hear a sample
of this raw talent by [clicking
here](https://www.justiceforrickieslaughter.com).

Rickie needs donations to help realize this dream and help share his work with
others in the world. Just because his body is captive doesn't mean that the
value of his art, words, and ideas should be. His voice and perspective could
help continue to spark important discussions. With your donations and support,
Rickie will be able to purchase the necessary copyrights to protect his creative
works, any trademarks necessary for a podcast as well as decent equipment for
quality sound production of the spoken word poems as well as materials needed
for expressive visual artwork. It will also allow him to bring bring this work
to the world through wherever podcasts and visual artwork are made available
to the public without fear of privacy or theft of his creative works.

Support of this effort will enable Rickie to maintain the freedom to work,
create, publish, and produce at will at a quality worthy of his talents. Thank
you for your help and your support.

Please encourage others to support this effort. For $25 Rickie will write a
custom poem about you.
