### Deleting your Facebook account: Permanently deleting your account

* Your personal photos, videos, and status updates you’ve shared over the years
  can be deleted after following these steps:
  * Navigate to settings
  * Under security and login, click ‘your facebook information’
  * Proceed to ‘Delete Your Account and Information’
    *	Once there you will have the option to either delete or deactivate your account
      * Deactivating your account WILL NOT delete your data from facebook
    *	After deleting your Facebook account, you will have a 30-day grace period to change your mind
      * Following the 30 days, all of your information will be inaccessible
      * HOWEVER, there is still some Information that could be visible to other users:
        * Messages you have sent to friends
        * Any information friends and family members have posted about you (due
          to this being their personal data, not yours)

Upon requesting to delete your Facebook account, it takes approximately 90 days
to delete data stored in backup systems.

### Ability to Manually delete information from Facebook:

* This is a safe option for those that do not want to delete all of their data
  * Navigate to the settings
  * Click ‘your facebook information’ located under the ‘security and login’ tab
  * Continue to ‘Delete your account and information’
  * Once there, proceed to ‘Download your information’
    * You will then see the ‘Access your information’ page
* From there, you will have access to your posts, posts you’re tagged in, notes, posts hidden from your timeline, etc.,from which you can manually delete.

### “Shadow profiles”:

* After asking users for their contact lists, Facebook collects data which includes lists of emails, phone numbers, and even names.
  * Facebook then makes “shadow profiles” based on individuals who have uploaded a user's contact information. (meaning individuals who have never created a Facebook account, may still have a profile on facebook)
    * Requests may be made to ensure that an individual's contact information (phone number, name, and email address) is removed

### Off-Facebook Activity: Protection from 3rd parties

    * IMPORTANT:’Off-Facebook Activity’ allows an individual to erase the user data that Facebook has accumulated through these 3rd parties
* How to access Off-Facebook Activity:
  * Navigate to settings
  * Scroll down to ‘Your Facebook Information’
  * Select ‘Off-Facebook Activity’
    * This will allow you to view the websites and apps that have been sharing your personal information, set limits on how this data sharing occurs in the future, and delete the associated histories
  * At the top of the page you can select ‘Clear History’ which will erase all the Off-Facebook data presented, stopping these 3rd parties from sharing your data
