# Neon Law Next.JS

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see
the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.js`. The page
auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Whitelabeled Websites

Our website renders different pages based off the incoming host. You can access
these whitelabeled websites locally by starting Next on a different port. For
instance, you can start the JusticeForRickieSlaughter.com website by running:

```bash
yarn dev -p 3001
```

Then after navigating to `localhost:3001` you should see the Justice for Rickie
Slaughter webpage.
