# Unemployment In Nevada

If you have recently lost your job, it is paramount you act quickly to pick
yourself up and get back on your feet. We believe in you!

Additionally, you may be entitled to receiving unemployment benefits. We
recommend that you check your eligibility on the [Nevada unemployment
website](http://ui.nv.gov). At the time of this writing, you *must* file your
claim online. The Nevada website has a [series of
videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKU0G2uxOM7AwxvSH-GyeQAgiwxHFzEdF)
to guide you through the process should you get stuck.

## Filing your claim

If you are no longer working, you and you alone have the responsibility of
filing for your unemployment benefits. Without filing for these benefits,
the state will not know that you are no longer working and cannot provide
you unemployment assistance should you be eligible.

To file a successful claim, you need to prove that you did not engage in
misconduct and were either laid off or had to quit your job because of some
exceptional circumstance like a boss who sexually harassed you or unsafe
working conditions.

> If you have been sexually harassed or exposed to dangerous working
> conditions, you may have a case against your employer. We offer
> [free consultations](/contact) to discuss the merits of your case.

Please refer to the regulations of the administrative body handling
unemployment, the [Department of Employment, Training, and
Rehabilitation](https://detr.nv.gov).

## After filing your claim, start looking for jobs.

After filing your claim, you have to look for work, which is something
you should be doing anyway. You can look to
[Craigslist](https://craigslist.org), [Amazon Jobs](https://amazon.jobs/en/),
local newspapers and magazines, and your friends and family. DETR and the
unemployment office also have resources to help you find your next job.

While looking for your next job will help you get back on your feet, DETR
requires you to be able, available, and actively seeking work. Or in other
words, you can't collect unemployment checks and play videogames all day.

## What happens if I am denied unemployment benefits?

If you are denied unemployment benefits, you have the chance to appeal that
decision if you do so within the allotted timeframe, which as of the time of
this writing, is 11 days. The officer that issued your unemployment decision
will have the most up-to-date information about filing an appeal.
