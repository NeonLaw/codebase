# Debt Relief

Before we consider [filing for bankruptcy](/bankruptcy), we will work with
your debtors to see if we can arrange for a settlement of the full balance
owed for a fraction of the cost. This is the in the best interest of all
parties because the creditor gets paid and the debtor is relieved of the
debt, now and forever.

Our firm can communicate with creditors and debtors on your behalf so you
don't have to via a power of attorney. A power of attorney means that we can
act on your behalf for the limited purpose of settling your debt.
Even if you can make your payments and are barely getting by, a debt
settlement plan with our office can get you ahead of the curve and get you to
a point where your money works for you.

[Contact Us](/contact) if you would like to schedule a consultation.
