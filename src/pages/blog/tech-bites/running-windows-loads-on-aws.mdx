AWS Supports running SQL Server, the Microsoft flavor of RDS and can encrypt the data using TDE, or Transparent Data Encryption, which encrypts data before its written and decrypts it as its being read. TDE is a Microsoft service. You can also use SQL Server with multi-AZ deployment.

Active Directory
You can run Active Directory on AWS with AWS Directory Service, which is a fully managed Microsoft AD.

Amazon FSx
This is a service that provides fully managed Windows Filesystems on AWS. It is kind of like EFS, but can be used for Windows Applications. You can use FSx for using Windows-based file systems that use the SMB protocol.
