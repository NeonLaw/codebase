# Wills and Trusts

## A valid will

A valid will must be either:

* in writing, signed by the testator, and two witnesses at the same time. The
  two witnesses must acknowledge that the testator is indeed creating a will;
  OR
* in the handwriting of the testator, dated and signed. This is a holographic
  will.

### What can make a valid will invalid

The testator must be at least 18 and of sound mind. A will can be invalid if
the will was fradulently executed, either by inducement to create the will,
or fraud in preventing a testator to revoke the will (a testator can revoke a
will at any time).

#### Undue Influence

In common law, undue influence happens when the testator is susceptible to
influence, the influencer had the opportunity to influence testator to make
an **unnatural disposition**, or a claim in their will they would not have
otherwise made, and the beneficiary is active in procuring a disposition.

In California, undue influence requires excessive persuasion by someone who
causes another to act or refrain and overcomes to their free will to acquire
an unequal result.
