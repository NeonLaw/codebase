## A valid will

A valid will must be either:

* in writing, signed by the testator, and two uninterested witnesses at the
  same time. The two witnesses must acknowledge that the testator is indeed

* in the handwriting of the testator, dated and signed. This is a holographic
  will.

### What can make a valid will invalid

The testator must be at least 18 and of sound mind. A will can be invalid if
the will was fradulently executed, either by inducement to create the will,
or fraud in preventing a testator to revoke the will (a testator can revoke a
will at any time).

  without the influencer present, OR

A will is valid if it complies to the laws where the will was executed:
