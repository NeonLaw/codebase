We use GCP Storage Buckets to store files in managed blob storage, to have
our Postgraphile API be aware of changes of these files, we have implemented
the following UML diagram for a user to upload their files.

<Image />

1. Create the signed URL through the GraphQL API

> As of today, we do not support resumable uploads. For large files, we
> communicate with our clients via a shared Google Drive folder.

2. Client would upload to that URL
3. That would go into a temporary bucket - all objects expire in a day

4. The URL would send the URL to GraphQL through the proper place
  This would be a custom mutation like `setUserAvatar`, `setUserRetainer`
  `addDocument`, `addAttachment`

5. The temporary URL would be sent as part of the mutation

6. Wrap the resolver - create a signed url to read
