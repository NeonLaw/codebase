Our application has four authorization roles:

* Anonymous, or users of our application that are not logged in.
* Portal, or our customers that we serve.
* Lawyer, or our [network of affiliate attorneys](/about-us).
* Admin, or the Neon Law team, supervised by in-house attorneys.

These roles are assumed by users (if you are not logged in, you are an
anonymous user right now) and correspond to [Postgres roles in our
api](https://github.com/NeonLaw/api/blob/development/migrations/committed/000002.sql),
and the data you can access here at NeonLaw.com.

In the diagram above, you'll see that an admin
can do everything, a lawyer can do a subset of what admin can do, a portal
user can do a subset of what lawyers can do, and anonymous users can do a
subset of what portal users can do. We scope each API request to one of these
four roles, which provides us a way to ensure the right people are getting
the right information.

While other systems have complex authorization schemes, ours does not need to
be more complicated than this. We've found that a tiered authorization scheme
is sufficient for the vast majority of authorization use cases. In our case
it is sufficient because it solves all use cases and we can rely on policy,
or the ethical standards that lawyers hold themselves accountable too (known
as the Model Rules of Professional Conduct) to ensure that even if a lawyer
or a person a lawyer supervises accesses information that they shouldn't,
they have an obligation to report their access to that information or
otherwise be subject to penalties.
